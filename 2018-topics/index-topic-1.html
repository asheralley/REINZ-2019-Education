In short, it simply does not achieve what the complainants’ wish which was in effect a right to use the vendor’s driveway to gain access to the carport.’

                                Since the complaint, the salesperson licensee had had the privilege of placing advertising directly with media - to meet advertising deadlines - rescinded and is now required, without exception, to provide administration with all relevant, signed vendor authorisations before commencing any marketing whatsoever of a vendor’s property. He also confirmed that subsequent to the complaint, the salesperson licensee had undergone an in-depth training session with him covering interpretation and implementation of the rules and penalties for breaches of the rules from the Code of Conduct.<br><br>

                                The agent licensee noted that ‘robust lines of communication’ were in place between himself and the salesperson licensee (based in different locations). Since the complaint he had placed further systems in place to ensure a much stricter monitoring of her activities as the agency’s representative at a different branch.

                            <p><b>Answer should relate to the following:</b><br><br>
                                The CAC noted [the salesperson licensee] had the right to place advertising for the property directly, rather than through the agency, at that time, but considered the agency’s checking systems were not thorough enough in this instance.<br><br>

                                The CAC suggested that a sound system would cross reference advertising expenses received (it is expected invoices would have been sent to the agency over the several weeks of marketing) against a valid, signed agency agreement. This either did not happen, or the agency’s administration did not make [the salesperson licensee] aware of the discrepancy. The CAC noted the absence of a signed agency agreement remained undiscovered for just over three months.
