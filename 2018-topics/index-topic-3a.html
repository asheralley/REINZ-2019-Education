                                ‘While it was not best practice of the auctioneer to proceed without the third signature, his reliance on the assertions and conduct of the complainants in allowing the auction to proceed and the preparatory work of [the salesperson licensee] as the listing agent, meant that his conduct in relying on the documentation provided to him did not amount, by a narrow margin, to unsatisfactory conduct.’

                                The situation involved one entity (X Property Developments Ltd) that had entered into an agency agreement with the real estate agency and another entity (Coumat Ltd), with the same directorship, that signed the sale and purchase agreement (which became unconditional). <br><br>

                                The Court of Appeal held that the agency could not rely on a deed of novation or the shared directorship, to claim the right to commission.

                                It was noted that this was not an ordinary case and found that the heads of agreement should be interpreted as not to require the signature of both owners on any listing agreement; and, rather, the heads of agreement contemplated each party engaging their own real estate agent, who would then work together to market the property for sale under a joint sole agency.
