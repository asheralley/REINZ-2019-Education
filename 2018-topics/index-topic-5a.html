                                The CAC said it was clear the salesperson licensee had information confidential to the vendor (the value and conditions of the complainant’s offer), and could use that information to benefit himself (although that may not have been his motivation).<br><br>

                                The CAC said a senior independent person within the agency should have handled the multiple offer situation and present the offers to ensure that the process was transparent and that all parties were dealt with fairly. <br><br>

                                The CAC considered the licensee’s conduct in presenting both offers was in breach of rules 6.2 and 9.16.

                                The Tribunal said the licensee's decision (as branch manager) to not present the multiple offers himself and instead to allow the salesperson licensee to do this was reasonable given the lack of conflict between the salesperson licensee and any of the potential purchasers. They were all the salesperson licensee’s direct contacts, so there was no evidence, or reason, for any personal bias.

                                The customer (potential purchaser/lessee) should also be made aware that the vendor/lessor may choose to negotiate to the exclusion of others or indeed negotiate with all interested parties.<br><br>

                                The customer (potential purchaser/lessee) will need to be assured that no other party will be made aware of the nature or extent of their offer).

                                In situations where the client instructs the licensee to try to obtain a better price than those offered on closing date, a suggested solution is for the licensee to go back to each potential purchaser/lessee on the basis that the vendor/lessor has instructed the licensee that none of the current offers have reached the vendor/lessor’s expectations and ask if they are prepared to increase their offer at this time.<br><br>

                                It is also important to ask the potential purchasers/lessees not to withdraw their offer until the vendor/lessor has had more time to consider the situation. The potential purchaser(s)/lessee(s) need to agree to keep their offer(s) ‘alive’.<br><br>

                                It should always be remembered, however, that either party is able to withdraw its offer or counter-offer at any time prior to acceptance and, the Notice of Withdrawal is communicated prior to the Notice of Acceptance. The parties should be advised of their rights with regard to this.<br><br>

                                In these cases, a timeframe should be imposed by the licensee and indeed any potential purchaser/lessee may require an answer within a stated timeframe. This is important to give certainty as to final close-off time for acceptance or otherwise.<br><br>

                                Vendor/lessor timeframes must be reasonable and in writing.<br><br>

                                All offers should be in a sealed envelope and should be presented to the vendor/lessor at the same time.
