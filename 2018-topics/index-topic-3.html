                                - The owner had given the licensee the accountant’s phone number and told the licensee to deal with the solicitor as well, but that the accountant was the main point of contact.<br><br>

                                - The licensee said he did not deal with the owner at material times because the owner had told him to deal with the accountant.<br><br>

                                - Both the accountant and the licensee said the owner had previously explained that due to his job the owner was often on the road and difficult to contact and commonly did not respond to messages, so neither party was particularly concerned that he hadn’t been communicating during the process.<br><br>

                                - The licensee said that when the owner declined to proceed with the sale, he, was baffled as he had been in constant touch with the owner for well over a year and knew he wanted the apartment sold and that had been constantly confirmed by the accountant and solicitor.

                                1. The CAC found that by initiating the 180-day exclusive agency agreement and in failing to release the vendor (who was not GST registered) from the exclusive agency, the salesperson licensee was in breach of rules 5.1 (and 6.1). Setting up this length of agreement for this transaction was also not in line with agency policy.<br><br>

                                2. Email evidence showed the salesperson licensee did not obtain the accountant’s signature on the listing agreement until after he was aware of the complaint. The email to the accountant requested his signature ‘To be correct …’ <br><br>

                                The CAC said the salesperson licensee’s action in asking the accountant to sign after-the-fact indicated that he knew that all the proprietors needed to sign the listing agreement, and that it was insufficient to have the vendor alone sign, even if as agent for a trustee company.
