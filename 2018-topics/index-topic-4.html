                                The Tribunal said:<br><br>

                                ‘The Tribunal does not agree that in this case rule 6.4 was breached. The [salesperson licensee], the manager and the agency took the issue seriously, considered what to do and took legal advice.<br><br>

                                ‘There is a fine line between over-disclosure of facts that may damage a vendor’s right to sell their property at a fair market price and under-disclosure which is unfair to a purchaser.<br><br>

                                In this case we consider that [the salesperson licensee] appropriately achieved the right balance.<br><br>

                                To disclose a rumour would potentially have breached the agent’s fiduciary duty to her vendor in this case.<br><br>

                                We therefore conclude that [the salesperson licensee] did not breach rule 6.4 and that obtaining legal advice from the vendor’s solicitors, and inserting in the agreement the clause that was drafted by both solicitors, addressed appropriately her obligations under rule 6.4.’

                                The licensee advised the dairy owner that he could insert a special clause in the sale and purchase agreement to address methamphetamine issues, but the dairy owner chose not to proceed any further.<br><br>

                                The licensee advised his manager and one of the other licensees.<br><br>

                                There was no evidence at the time that the property was contaminated, and the licensees had spoken to the neighbours, who had not mentioned any issues.<br><br>

                                Accordingly, the CAC concluded that the licensees had taken sufficient steps in the circumstances, and were not required to make further enquiries.

                                As a result of the information learned from the neighbour about likely methamphetamine contamination, the licensee recommended to the vendor that the next two open homes be suspended pending the obtaining of a drug test of the property. This advice was accepted by the vendor.<br><br>

                                The tests established that the pool cabana area was contaminated but the rest of the property was clear. The licensee, in conjunction with the vendor, agreed to close all of the pool cabana area with emergency tape so it could not be entered.<br><br>

                                The licensee indicated to the vendor that he would continue with the open homes provided that he had seen and read the test results, and that the drug results were to be fully disclosed to all prospective purchasers.  The vendor agreed to this. At the agency manager’s suggestion, a due diligence clause was included in the offer document.<br><br>

                                Verification of actions taken was provided to the CAC by the licensee through phone logs and voice memorandums repeated by the licensee.<br><br>

                                A copy of the offer was also produced, which had an acknowledgement by the complainants that they were made aware of a positive meth test.<br><br>

                                Further offers that were made on the property also showed similar disclosures of the meth test and recommendation for due diligence.<br><br>

                                The licensee also produced a series of emails between the agency and the REAA in relation to how to market the property in the circumstances described. The advice from the REAA was very much in line with the approach taken by the licensee.

                                The agency’s intranet notification should have at least been qualified with a note that the vendors had not consented for the information to be discussed with anyone at that stage – indeed, because they had yet to be informed of the issue.<br><br>

                                The CAC found that, although the purchasers who had contracts for the property were informed of the contamination, it appeared that the first licensee had played down the level of contamination by referring to it as ‘trace level’.<br><br>

                                The CAC determined that the licensee knew, or should have known, the level of contamination was higher than the recommended safety level after receiving the test results, and should have disclosed this to all potential purchasers.<br><br>

                                The CAC also determined that the agency, in failing to notify its staff of the potential risk to their health and safety, had engaged in conduct below the acceptable standard.
