                                The CAC said that the chance of a (possibly) better offer has been lost to the vendor as the complainant’s offer was never clarified or recorded in writing for him to consider. The CAC considered fiduciary obligations to the client vendor were not met in this regard and found a breach of rule 6.1. The CAC noted, had the vendor wished to pursue the offer from the complainant and her husband, the offer could not be binding if not in writing.<br><br>

                                The CAC accepted the vendor had a right to choose not to deal with a multiple offer but considered the vendor was not able to make an informed choice as licensee 1 misrepresented the offer from the complainant and her husband.

                                The CAC had serious concerns that this advice was given when the offer from the complainant and her husband was not in writing in any form and they had no knowledge their ‘offer’ was even being presented, let alone was effectively part of a multiple offer.<br><br>

                                The CAC considered advice should have been given that licensee 1 step aside from negotiations with the vendor, as she could not be impartial in a presentation in these circumstances.
