                                The licensee should have made sure an agency agreement was in place and provided a written appraisal to the client before submitting offer documents.

                                - The branch manager’s evidence was that he gave the vendors a single-page document headed ‘[Agency’s] Comparative Market Sales Appraisal’ (‘the [Agency] appraisal form’).<br><br>

                                - This document contains a section headed ‘Details of comparable properties available for analysis’, then a bold heading ‘Sale’.

For each of these sub-headings there are columns headed ‘Govt value $’, ‘Bedrooms’, ‘Land (m2)', ‘List Price’ and ‘Sold Price’.<br><br>

                                - Underneath this section there is a box labelled ‘Taking the above comparisons into account we would expect the market value of your property to be in the range of:’ In the space alongside this, the branch manager wrote ‘around $1,100,000’. In a ‘Comments’ box the branch manager wrote ‘CMA is attached along with PIMs of some of our recent sales’.<br><br>

                                - The branch manager’s evidence was that he gave the vendors an appraisal of the property (at ‘around $1.1 million’). He suggested that the appraisal form was included in the package of documents given to the vendors, and was overlooked when they signed other documents. <br>

                                - None of the sections on the agency appraisal form had been filled in.<br><br>

                                - The appraisal form was signed by the branch manager and dated. It had not been signed and dated by the vendors.<br><br>

                                - The Tribunal said:<br>

                                ‘Even if the branch manager had given the vendors an oral explanation of the ways in which the sales list and the PIMs provided the comparative information from which an appraisal could be provided, that patently would not have satisfied the requirement for the appraisal to be in writing.’<br><br>

                                The Tribunal also said:<br>

                                - ‘We find that in the present case, the vendors were not given a written appraisal of the property.<br><br>

                                - ‘While the real estate agency appraisal form provides for information to be given (which would go some way towards satisfying the requirements for an appraisal), no such information was set out.<br><br>

                                - ‘Further, in light of the fact that the form was not signed by the vendors, whereas other documents they were given were signed (the agency contract itself, the agency's schedule of fees, and the marketing proposal), we accept the vendors' evidence that the branch manager did not give them that form.’

                                The Tribunal referred to the consideration of rules 10.2 and 10.3 in Rodgers v Real Estate Agents Authority, in which it was agreed that:<br><br>

                                ‘... an appraisal needs to do more than simply show a prospective client comparable properties and sales figures and must inform the prospective client why the properties have been selected and how that information translates into the appraised price that the licensee has arrived at for the property.’<br><br>

                                The Tribunal noted that, in this case in question, the real estate agency’s appraisal form ‘does not provide for any explanation as to how properties have been selected for comparison, or how that information translates into the appraised price arrived at.’
