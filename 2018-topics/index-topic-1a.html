                                The Tribunal said: ‘We accept that for an experienced salesperson a lesser degree of supervision may be sufficient to meet the obligation under the Act and Rules. However, we find that the [CAC] was correct to find that [the supervising agent] failed to meet his obligation to supervise the licensee salesperson. Such supervision as there was, at any stage of the sale process and the subsequent complaint, was some distance away from what would have been sufficient, even for an experienced salesperson, and [the supervising agent] failed to respond to the complainant’s complaint in the appropriate manner.’

                                The Tribunal considered that the supervising agent/agency should have ensured the new salesperson licensee was properly supervised, which included physically sitting with her when she was having the sale and purchase agreement signed and double checking that all important details were recorded on the agreement.

                                [The salesperson licensee] worked at office B. The [licensed agent] was asked for clarification as to who supervised [the salesperson licensee] at office B. His response was that he was the licensed agent and that day to day supervision of [the salesperson licensee] was provided by himself and licensee X, who was based at office B. Licensee X held a salesperson’s licence at the time.<br><br>
                                As licensee X held a salesperson's licence, not an agent’s or branch manager’s licence, he was not qualified to carry out supervision. It was up to the agency, through [the agent licensee], to ensure that proper supervisory mechanisms were in place for [the salesperson licensee]. The CAC was of the view that they were not. The failure to properly supervise [the salesperson licensee] was a breach of section 50 and unsatisfactory conduct.

                            <p>Answers could relate to the following, or similar, relevant points:<<br><br>
                                - Make sure you know which licensed agent or licensed branch manager is your designated supervisor. If you don’t know, make sure you ask! If your organisation uses a model where the person designated to be your supervisor is different to your line manager, or if your supervisor may change in different circumstances, make sure you are clear about these key relationships and who your supervisor is at any given time.<br><br>

                                - For clarity, if you don’t have one, request a written supervision plan/agreement which clearly identifies your supervisor and sets out the roles, responsibilities and practical steps that you and the supervisor will take to ensure the supervision arrangement is implemented.<br><br>

                                - If, for any reason, you feel that the arrangement in place is not providing you with the direction and control you need, talk to your supervisor!<br><br>

                                - Agreements should be well-written, with clauses that suit their intended purpose and are clear, unambiguous, and easily understood.  If you are unsure about drafting any agreement, you must seek help from your supervisor.<br><br>

                                - When working in an area of real estate you are not familiar with, for example, in a complex transaction, make sure that you ask for additional direction and control throughout the process.<br><br>

                                - If you have any concerns about the requirements of a client or customer involved in a particular transaction, make sure that you consult with your supervisor.<br><br>

                                - Make sure that you obtain and understand all documentation relating to the transaction. Seek advice from your supervisor as needed.<br><br>

                                - Make sure you attend all available training provided for you. This includes the 10 hours of compulsory verifiable continuing education, and other courses relevant to your role.<br><br>

                                - Pick the topics that you select for your 10 hours of compulsory non-verifiable continuing education wisely. Think about areas of skill you need to improve and areas of knowledge that you can expand that are important to your role.<br><br>

                                - Remember that if you are transferring to a different sector (a shift from/to residential, lifestyle, rural, commercial or business broking), you will need considerable training to meet the required minimum level of performance. Arrange this with your supervisor.<br><br>

                                - You may also need additional training/support if you are working on a transaction in an unfamiliar geographical location, where previously unfamiliar issues, such as different property zoning rules or hazards, may apply.<br><br>

                                - Whenever you anticipate or encounter a situation you are not sufficiently trained for, you should immediately ask for guidance from your supervising agent or branch manager. Such guidance may take the form of coaching, mentoring or training, or may require a more formal approach (for example, further formal academic study).<br><br>
