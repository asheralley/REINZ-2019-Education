                <p><i>Answer should make reference to the following:</i><br> 
                In the case of licensee 2, who had listed the property for sale on behalf of the agency, the CAC said he was responsible for obtaining and verifying information in regard to the property. The CAC considered the licensee’s conduct in respect of insurance cover was not carried out with due skill and care, as no attempt was evidenced to verify the details given by the vendor, either by contact with the insurer or by asking direct questions of the vendor.<br><br>
                The CAC said licensee 2 had a duty of care to check by direct question with the vendor if the scope of works figure was the pay-out amount, prior to advising prospective buyers that it was. Had the vendor been unwilling to disclose the actual amount, no pay-out figures should have been mentioned to buyers, as is often the case in an ‘as is, where is’ sale. The CAC determined licensee 2’s conduct was not carried out with skill and care in respect of pay-out information and resulted in the complainant being misled.<br><br>
                With regard to the complainant being passed an incomplete and unsigned copy of the vendor’s ‘earthquake claim and insurance information’ form by licensee 2, the CAC said the complainant had a right to be given the most complete copy, and considered licensee 2’s conduct in this respect to be lacking care. Both licensees were found to have breached rules 5.1 and 6.4 of the Code of Conduct 2012 as they misled the complainant by passing on unverified information.<br><br>
                The agency was found in breach of section 50 of the Real Estate Act as it failed to properly supervise and manage licensees 1 and 2, by not checking agency procedures were adhered to and not checking documentation relating to the property was factually correct before being passed to prospective purchasers.</p>
