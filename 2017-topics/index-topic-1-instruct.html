                  It is our view that the Act requires openness. A licensee must be open from the beginning of the sale process and as soon as any defect is known. We consider that this means that the information relating to known defects should be available at every open home in writing. If defects are later discovered, then those defects must be notified in writing immediately to all known potential purchasers and in writing to any subsequent purchaser.â€™
