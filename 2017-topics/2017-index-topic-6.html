                  The Disciplinary Tribunal said that a licensee is required to market a property honestly and skilfully to the best of his or her ability, taking ‘sensible endeavours’ to obtain a grip on matters relevant to the property and surrounding area. Licensees must be alert at all times about what is happening, or likely to happen, in the area in which they operate. The Disciplinary Tribunal said that the licensee has not failed in any particular way and the overall circumstances were such that he did not know about the mine proposal at material times but that was not due to any inadequacy on his behalf. The Disciplinary Tribunal said that while reading the public notices column of the local newspapers is relevant to a desirable high standard of alertness, not doing so, especially given the personal circumstances of the licensee, did not amount to unsatisfactory conduct.</p>

                  The Disciplinary Tribunal said: ‘…We find that the licensee has been at least negligent in not giving the same disclosure and advice to the complainants which she gave to another prospective purchaser at material times and in not outlining clearly enough to the complainants the risks they were incurring in purchasing the property...

                  The college principal had apparently informed the licensee that the intended science block would be located away from the boundary of the property and would not affect its views. The licensee said he passed on that information to the agent, stressing that she tell the complainants to contact the college for further information about the issue. The licensee said that because of the discussions he had had just recently with the agent and complainant he thought there was no need to disclose the letter or its contents.</p>

                  The CAC said they needed documentary evidence, for example, email or text messages to the complainants, disclosing the consent [diary entry was not enough]. They also said there should have been a disclosure statement in the sale agreement and noted that clause 6.1(2) of the sale agreement was unaltered. Significantly, clause 6.1(2) provides a vendor warranty and undertaking that the vendor has not “given any consent or waiver–which directly or indirectly affects the property and which has not been disclosed in writing to the purchaser.” The CAC said that these omissions demonstrate the licensee barely, if at all, turned his mind to the consent let alone disclosed the same to the complainants.</p>

                  As a result of the information learned from the neighbour about likely methamphetamine contamination, the licensee recommended to the vendor that the next two open homes be suspended pending the obtaining of a drug test of the property. This advice was accepted by the vendor.<br>
                  The tests established that the pool cabana area was contaminated but the rest of the property was clear. The licensee, in conjunction with the vendor, agreed to close all of the pool cabana area with emergency tape so it could not be entered. The licensee indicated to the vendor that he would continue with the open homes provided that he had seen and read the test results, and that the drug results were to be fully disclosed to all prospective purchasers.  The vendor agreed to this. At the agency manager’s suggestion, a due diligence clause was included in the offer document.<br>
                  Verification of actions taken was provided to the CAC by the licensee through phone logs and voice memorandums repeated by the licensee. A copy of the offer was also produced, which had an acknowledgement by the complainants that they were made aware of a positive meth test. Further offers that were made on the property also showed similar disclosures of the meth test and recommendation for due diligence.<br>
                  The licensee also produced a series of emails between the agency and the REAA in relation to how to market the property in the circumstances described. The advice from the REAA was very much in line with the approach taken by the licensee.</p>

                  The licensee had been assured by the vendor that a safe and sanitary report would be made available for the self-contained guesthouse. As the licensee had not sighted the safe and sanitary report and therefore was unable to confirm its contents, he made it clear to prospective purchasers that this was the situation and that they should make their own enquiry.<br>
                  The licensee did not leave the matter there but followed up with the vendor, which in due course brought about a specialist report that confirmed no safe and sanitary report existed. The advertising was accordingly changed (‘income’ was removed).<br>
                  The CAC said: ‘Advertising the property in a certain manner, based on assurances from the vendor that they would provide written proof, is in the Committee's opinion, appropriate, so long as the licensee is making it clear to prospective purchasers that the evidence as yet is to be provided by the vendor and they should make their own enquiries.’</p>
