                ‘…A licensee is not required to be a surveyor but in cases like this; where the front boundary, was not where it appeared to be, and the back boundary was in bush we consider that the licensee should have been on notice that a disclaimer [relating to the boundaries] may have been required in the marketing material.<br>

                The CAC said ‘if a licensee suspects cladding or any other material used in the construction of a dwelling might contain asbestos, then this is a matter that must be discussed with a vendor client before marketing a property. It is also a matter that must in all fairness be disclosed to a purchaser prior to an agreement for sale and purchase being signed…’<br>
                ‘The obvious course of action would have been for the complainant to instruct the licensee to disclose that possibility to any prospective purchaser whereby the prospective purchaser could take further advice and make an informed decision about whether or not to continue with the purchase. Alternatively, had the complainant been advised by the licensee of the possibility of asbestos in the cladding at the time of listing and instructed the licensee not to disclose this defect to purchasers, the licensee would have been required under rule 10.8 to terminate the agency agreement…’</p>
