                  Regarding the problem with clause 19, the Tribunal said that while he identified it, he did not make further enquiries with the licensees to confirm the true nature of the clause and its intentions which was regrettable as even though the agreement was signed had he intervened, the problems that were later experienced, (with the purchaser discovering that the carport needed to be torn down), could have perhaps been dealt with at an earlier time and prior to settlement to allow for the involvement of the lawyers for the parties.

                  The supervision provided by the agency at that time was not effective and was compromised by the understanding [the licensee acting as branch manager] was the authorised branch manager (and expected to supervise other salespersons) when in fact she was not qualified to act in this capacity.
                  ‘The natural implication to be taken from the title ‘branch manager’, is that the person holds a branch manager’s licence, and to have a branch manager who does not have such a licence is misleading or potentially misleading to clients and customers.
